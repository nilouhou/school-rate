# Rate School

Most families are looking for a great school to send their kids which has a great education ranking, fewer bullies, great principals, and teachers who care about them. 
Traditionally, we hear the review from word of mouth. Nowadays, google reviews and Reddit discussions are available to view reviews, but are they adequate and have all information? 
That would be nice to go to a website or app where you can see everything in one place and share and read reviews about schools in Vancouver. This is the goal of this app.
